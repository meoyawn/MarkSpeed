## Listenbox subscription

As long as you have an active subscription to the [Creator plan](/pricing)
your podcast will be automatically synchronized with YouTube.

If you want _different title and artwork_ for audio and video podcasts, add the same YouTube link again.
It will create a second copy of the show, then you can describe it differently and get separate download stats for audio
and video.
